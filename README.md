# Random Password Generator

## Intro

Theres two reasons for me making this page. The first reason being for a class challenge in Module 3 but secondly and most importantly I am horrible at comming up with my own "secure" passwords. This site will inevitably assist me in that and I'm hoping anyone who visits will find it equally as helpful.

## Outro

Thank you for visiting this project! I will hopefully be making improvements slowly throughout the course as I learn and become more familiar with JavaScript. This is the first real implementation of JavaScript I have done thus far, not all of it was on my own but I'm getting there and plan to continue to grow on the subject throughout the years to come. Bear with me as this project works but has its flaws. Thanks again to everyone that has given me input and feedback so far. It is greatly appreciated and will continue to help me improve!
